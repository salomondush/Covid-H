Project: Covid-H

A coronavirus symptoms screening web prototype that could connect critical patients with doctors through automatic appointment and also provide
updated covid-19 cases per country and worldwide to users. This also allows the doctor to perform basic tasks like adding medications, symptoms,
and complications to a patient object.
